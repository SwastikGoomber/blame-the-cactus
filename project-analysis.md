# Cactus Farming Game - Project Analysis

## Project Origin & Concept

**Based on a true story**: A Minecraft server incident where the user created an automatic cactus farm that became an inside joke. The farm was built to generate "source" from Ars Nouveau mod using agronomic sourcelink, but ended up being blamed for every server issue that occurred afterward.

**Game Concept**: A goofy, interactive web-based cactus farming simulator that intentionally lags the browser and recreates the chaos and blame culture from the original Minecraft incident.

## Final Project Vision

### Core Game Type

- **Style**: Side-scrolling farming game (similar to Terraria)
- **Art Style**: Minecraft-inspired pixel art
- **Tone**: Intentionally goofy and absurd, not professional
- **Technical Goal**: Actually lag the browser as farms grow (intentional performance degradation)

### Key Gameplay Mechanics

#### Manual Farming System

1. **Tools Required**:

   - **Cactus Seeds**: Used to plant crops (purchasable in packs of 5)
   - **Magic Wands**: Spam-click to grow planted cacti (upgradeable with AOE, drag abilities)
   - **Hoes**: Click mature cacti to harvest for Source (upgradeable with AOE, drag abilities)

2. **Farming Process**:

   - Plant cactus seeds on farming blocks (0% growth)
   - Use wand to manually grow cacti by spam-clicking
   - Harvest mature cacti (100% growth) with hoe to generate Source

3. **Grid System**:
   - Single horizontal row of farming blocks (like Terraria)
   - Adjacent planting only - no random placement
   - 120px farming blocks for good visibility
   - 30% ground / 30% farming area / 40% sky layout

#### Inventory & Tool Management

- **Hotbar**: 5 slots, accessible via 1-5 keys
- **Inventory**: 8x grid modal system
- **Drag & Drop**: Full functionality between inventory and hotbar
- **Starting Items**: Hotbar pre-loaded with seeds, wooden wand, wooden hoe
- **Upgrades**: Purchased tools go to inventory first, then can be moved to hotbar

#### Automatic Farms

1. **Farm Types** (each with unique setup minigame):

   - Basic Cactus Farm (vanilla Minecraft)
   - Piston Cactus Farm (redstone automation)
   - Mystical Agriculture Plot (modded magic)
   - Plant Gatherer (Industrial Foregoing)
   - Stardew Greenhouse (Stardew Valley style)

2. **Setup Minigames**:

   - **Mod Approval Form**: Bureaucratic paperwork with moving checkboxes
   - **Cactus Lottery**: Rigged slot machine (3-6 attempts to win)
   - **Count the Cacti**: Memory game with 9x9 grid, 3-second timer
   - **Tech Calibration**: For advanced farms
   - **Sprinkler Puzzle**: For greenhouse farms

3. **Farm Upgrades**: Minecraft mod items like Lilypad of Fertility, Growth Accelerator, Time Torch

#### Currency & Economy

- **Source**: Generated by harvesting cacti
- **Uses**: Purchase tool upgrades, farm buildings, and farm upgrades
- **Balance**: Configurable via developer config file

### Chaos & Humor Elements

#### TPS (Ticks Per Second) System

- Real-time TPS calculation starting at 20 (like Minecraft)
- Decreases based on farm activity, total cacti, automation level
- Visual warnings and effects when TPS drops
- Screen shakes, jitters, fake lag spikes at low TPS

#### Blame Event System

- Random fake players blame you for unrelated server issues
- Examples:
  - "My sheep are glitching through walls! @CactusFarmer fix your farm!"
  - "The moon is square now. This has to be related to those cacti somehow..."
  - "Water is flowing upward near spawn... cactus magic strikes again!"
- Customizable fake player names and avatars (developer configurable)

#### NPC Systems

1. **Cactus Cultists**:

   - Appear randomly every few minutes
   - Slide in from left/right with walking animation
   - Bow to cacti, speak praise in text bubbles
   - Leave in random direction
   - Purely atmospheric for comedic effect

2. **Fake Moderators**:
   - Randomly appear to inspect farms
   - Make passive-aggressive comments about tick usage
   - Hover around suspiciously
   - Customizable usernames and avatars

#### Server Crash Simulation

- After configurable time (default 15 minutes)
- Fullscreen warning: "SERVER CRASH IMMINENT - Reason: Cactus Farm Overload"
- Actually closes and reopens the game normally

#### Achievement System

- Developer-customizable achievements
- Examples:
  - "Server Killer": Drop TPS below 10
  - "Blame Master": Get blamed 20 times
  - "Cult Following": Have cultists visit

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Technology

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: CSS with Minecraft-style design
- **Fonts**: Press Start 2P for retro feel
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

#### Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Scroll left/right through the world
- **1-5 Keys**: Select hotbar slots
- **Mouse**: Click to interact, drag & drop items
- **ESC**: Close modals

#### Performance Features

- **Intentional Lag**: Excessive calculations to slow browser
- **Visual Effects**: Screen glitches, stutters, performance warnings
- **Lag Level Indicator**: Shows current performance impact

#### World System

- **3000px wide scrollable world**
- **Parallax backgrounds** with multiple layers
- **Ground textures** and environmental objects
- **Dynamic lighting effects** for mature cacti

## Asset Requirements

### Graphics Needed

1. **Cactus Sprites**: 3 growth stages (planted â†’ growing â†’ harvestable)
2. **Tool Icons**: 4 wand variants + 4 hoe variants showing progression
3. **Farm Buildings**: 5 different automated farm structures
4. **NPC Sprites**:
   - Cultist walking/bowing animations
   - Moderator inspection poses
5. **UI Elements**: Inventory slots, hotbar backgrounds, speech bubbles
6. **Environment**: Desert backgrounds, ground textures, sky layers

### Audio (Future Consideration)

- Background desert ambience
- Tool usage sounds
- Farm automation noises
- Blame event notification sounds

## Current Development Status

### âœ… Completed Features

- Side-scrolling game world with proper layout (30-30-40 split)
- Complete inventory and hotbar system with working drag & drop
- Manual farming mechanics (plant, grow, harvest)
- Tool upgrade system with AOE and drag abilities
- TPS monitoring and performance degradation
- Blame event system with configurable fake players
- Animated NPC system (cultists and moderators)
- Achievement system framework
- Automatic farm placement with minigames
- Responsive design and proper controls
- Text selection disabled to prevent accidental highlighting

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied

- Fixed drag & drop functionality between inventory and hotbar
- Corrected seed purchasing (now gives 5 seeds instead of 1)
- Implemented proper single-row farming grid (Terraria-style)
- Added click-outside-to-close for modals
- Enhanced visual layout with proper proportions

### ðŸ“‹ Configuration System

All game parameters are developer-configurable via CONFIG object:

- Fake player names and messages
- Moderator personalities
- Achievement definitions
- Economic balance (costs, generation rates)
- Server crash timer
- Farm specifications

## Development Notes

### Code Structure

- **Main App**: `frontend/src/App.js` contains all game logic
- **Styling**: `frontend/src/App.css` with Minecraft-inspired design
- **Configuration**: All customizable elements in CONFIG object at top of App.js

### Asset Integration

- Currently using placeholder stock images
- Ready for pixel art replacement
- Asset paths clearly documented in code comments

### Future Expansion Possibilities

- Additional farm types from other popular games
- More complex minigames for farm setup
- Multiplayer blame system (real chat integration)
- Sound effects and background music
- Mobile optimization
- Save/load game state

## Project Philosophy

This game perfectly captures the progression from "innocent farming" to "oh god what have I done" that made the original Minecraft incident legendary. It's designed to be:

1. **Immediately funny** - starts innocent but quickly becomes absurd
2. **Self-aware** - knows it's silly and leans into it
3. **Interactive** - requires skill and planning, not just clicking
4. **Nostalgic** - references Minecraft and farming game tropes
5. **Technically interesting** - actually impacts browser performance as intended

The game successfully transforms a real-world server incident into an engaging, humorous, and technically impressive web experience that celebrates the chaos and community blame culture that emerged from the original cactus farm incident.
